        <h1><b>Happy birthday, baby!!!<br><br></b></h1>
        <p> Before we get started, I just have some things to say.<br><br>I love you!!!<br><br>I love you more than I could ever love myself, more than I could love anyone else, I care about you and you alone, my love.<br>
            You have brought so much more excitement and feeling to my life, you brought me reason and passion. God, I look back at who I was before you and I feel dead, or at least dormant. To think I spent my days in stale acceptance that I had simply never met someone who truly clicked with my personality; Dealing with the obvious foreboding feeling that I would never find anyone who would fit my expectations.<br>
            As of writing this, you have been my girlfriend for 5459 hours and 28 minutes. Those have been the best 5459 hours and 29 minutes of my life so far (Had to account for my slow writing, lol), coincidentally, I'm listening to When You Leave, which reminds me of you and Resident Evil. I really treasure those memories, you know? ShadowLeggy's videos remind me of my early childhood. I don't think I ever told why exactly I love those videos so much. Well, it's because combining memories of you with memories of my childhood imparts your presence in them, making them feel less lonely.<br>
            I spent 19 years of my life without any true friends, and 12 or so desperately yearning for one. My desperation for such a connection eventually diminished, but never truly died. I eventually learned to be satisfied with the presence of people I could play games and have fun with, and to ignore the desire for more, the desire for someone I could share my naked soul with. I never thought this person would come along.<br>
            My angel, my soulmate, I love you, and little Lucas loves you too.<br><br><br></p>
