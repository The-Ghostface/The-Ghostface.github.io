  <p>One of my favorite things about being with you is having someone to listen to me sleeptalking... I really treasure those moments, even tho I can barely remember them. Knowing I have someone</p>
  <p>to listen to me at my most vulnerable and honest, someone I feel completely comfortable with is just amazing. I love you so much, I feel like our love is so pure, and I know this is special.</p>
  <p>I love you, I'm so sorry for the times I was mean to you, and it makes me so, so happy that you forgive me. Sometimes it horrifies me that you could think that I'm not the person you fell in love with...</p>
  <p>Thank you for being you, I love everything about you.</p>
