        <p>To my love, my Morning Star and my blue moon.
There is so much I want to say and so few words I know how to use... Even writing this down feels like this horrible battle of attrition between wanting to be honest and trying to not sound ridiculous. It's also trying to mention all that I feel and trying not to ramble.<br>

It is hell, and, for this text, it's all that I can give you, honey. Please try to look past the things that might sound edgy or cringey; I am being honest and writing from the heart.<br>

This is going to be a lot about me, since I think it's truly impossible to write about other people; I barely know myself, how could I expect to know anyone else?<br>

I overthink so much, so much that I feel like "overthink" isn't an adequate descriptor of what I go through on a daily basis. I can't hold genuine opinions; I can't think about myself and my own thoughts without double-guessing myself in an exhausting cycle of reading into these thoughts, debating them, not reaching a conclusion, and repeating until I just can't anymore.<br>

This feels completely void of meaning, and it's pointless to say, but I need you to understand that I don't like being by myself, but I despise being in bad company. Being by myself is like having a fork in the waste disposal that's between my ears; being around people sometimes feels like being in the waste disposal. It doesn't always feel like that, and I can handle and enjoy social interaction for the most part, but if it goes on for long enough, it surely leads to restlessness.<br>

But you, you little devil, you are the opposite. You cause me a whole lot of pain sometimes, but all of that pain isn't a fraction of the balm that your love and presence are to my mind. When I'm with you, I get to calm down. I get to feel like it doesn't matter whether or not I'm the smartest human being alive, it doesn't matter if I'm right about anything, all that matters is that you're with me, and I'm with you. I love the United States, I love the northern climate, and I'd love to visit their beautiful cities. I'd love to earn more money than most people do. Some years ago, I used to be obsessed with the United States. I used a foreign culture as a replacement for a completely lacking sense of pride in my own, out of fear of mockery for not being from a first-world country, out of desperate need for approval of the people from cultures I deemed superior, I needed to be in the in-group, I needed to not be an outsider. Today, I merely enjoy your country; every day I feel less and less desperation and misguided pride. You are, ironically, curing my Anglo-fanaticism.<br>

And if this was too verbose or confusing, you make me feel safe. Safe as I never thought I could be, safe to make mistakes and to be truly myself, without the millions of layers of self-questioning and internal and external manipulations that tried to make me someone I was not - all of the bullshit.<br>

You are an angel in my life, my love. You are a blessing I never asked for because I didn't know I needed it.<br>

You are beautiful, top to bottom, inside and out. And I wholeheartedly feel that you were made for me.<br>

Happy birthday, my love. I'm sorry for dumping so much on you, but those words are what my heart is full of, and I had to share them with you.<br></p>
